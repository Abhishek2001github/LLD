/*flow - adaptee -> Adapter -> Client
 It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by clients
Application
When you want to reuse a class but its interface doesnâ€™t match the requirement.
When you have legacy code that needs to interact with modern systems.
To integrate third-party APIs that have incompatible interfaces*/
